# Weather-Dashboard-HW-6

(EDIT) This weekâ€™s homework required to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* I chose [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) as my library.

## Purpose: ##

User is a traveler
They want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
So that they can plan a trip accordingly

## Criteria Includes: ##

* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index
* THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
* WHEN I open the weather dashboard
* THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
