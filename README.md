# Weather-Dashboard-HW-6

This weekâ€™s homework required to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
I used [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) to retrieve weather data for cities. I used  localStorage throoughout the application to store any persistent data.


## Purpose: ##

User is a traveler
<br>
They want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
<br>
So that they can plan a trip accordingly

## Criteria Includes: ##

* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index
* THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
* WHEN I open the weather dashboard
* THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
